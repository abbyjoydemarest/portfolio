            <p>Before we delved into the world of JavaScript one of our group assignments was to develop an app that gave people the opportunity to post links to websites related to a specific area of interest. My project partner and I both love data driven and generative art, so GenArt was born. This projct is important to me because it was our first group project. We did a lot of pair programming, which was a new concept to me, but I found it to be extremly valuable and impactful.</p>

            <p> The calculator project was one of my most favorite individual projects to do at Momentum Learning, Inc. This was our first stab at JavaScript and I liked being able to use JavaScript to enhance the user's experience. When the user clicks on a number on the calculator the background turns a shade of blue that correlates to that number (ex: 0 is the lightest blue, 9 is the darkest blue). </p>

                <h3 class="project-header">techShuffle</h3> <br>
                <p> techShuffle was my first coding group project. I learned a lot about project management and utilizing JavaScript with other programming languages to enhance the code. <br>For this project I did some user research to figure out our project's design. I asked the other students in our cohort what their flash cards looked like when they were in school. From physical size, to color, to even what people used to hold their flash cards together. From all of this information I came up with the idea of making our logo look like an index card and having a green (most common color that people remembered) rubberband to hold it together. <br>
                I enjoyed using CSS and HTML together to come up with a way to show the flashcards on the page as well. It took a lot of creativity, and I was happy with how the flash cards turned out in the end. <br> We were not extremely well versed with JavaScript at this point and were not able to get the show and hide functions or ability to flip the cards. We instead decided to use font coloring in CSS to highlight the answer to the question when a person hovered over it. This was a creative solution to a technical problem, that we know now how to do with JavaScript. </p>
